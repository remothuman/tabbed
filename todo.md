# Todo

## Bugs
- focusing an app from dock (or from link from other app, etc) should change the active tab
- dragging the tab bar container does not drag the windows, also in its current design the extra space below the actual tabs is unecessary



- Maybe: remove the functionality of increasing app size once freed. often covers up tab bar of other windows.
    - when quitting tabbed all together it is still good
- change x icon on tab which frees the window, change it to a - icon or another icon we find




## Maybe:
- allow one tab windows
- change up tab design (and/or/none)
    - make tabs shorter (more like chrome not safari)
    - add a close/release window button

- Find way to hide non active windows completely (maybe settle for minimizing). esp so that it doesnt show up in AltTab (and mission control etc) and instead the metawindow is what shows up
    - int his case also customize the window name maybe?

- launch an app in addition to capturing an existing app



## Post-MVP Features
- Keyboard shortcuts for tab switching (using Hyper key to avoid conflicts with in-app shortcuts)
- Persist groups across app restarts (match by app bundle ID + window title, best-effort) / restore previous session option on startup

Maybe:
- Drag a tab out of the tab bar to release it
- Drag a tab into another group's tab bar to move between groups
